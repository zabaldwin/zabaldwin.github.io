Abstract located below:

By using data collected from Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator (JLab), I will be observing two specific reactions from the 
collision of linearly polarized photons with protons in a liquid hydrogen target. In this work, studies of the neutral pion 
reaction will be presented along with an exploratory study of the Compton scattering process. These reactions were studied by 
utilizing the fine-grained calorimetry of the GlueX experiment in order to aid in the understanding of meson production 
mechanisms in high-energy photoproduction. The separation of neutral pions and Compton events is challenging due to potential 
merging of the neutral pion decay photons into a single shower for large polar angles and high momentum. This merging causes 
neutral pion decay photons with a small opening angle to look like single Compton photon showers. As a result, electromagnetic 
shower shape variables are used to study these effects, and with the introduction of three new width variables, comparisons 
between data and Monte Carlo samples are obtained to estimate the signal purity for these two reactions. These results will 
provide a stepping stone to ultimately measure the sigma beam asymmetry for large angle Compton scattering events.
