I grew up deep in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, tucked away in a <em>holler</em> near the boarder of Virgina and Tennessee. It's a place where cows outnumber people and apparently our accents leave people wanting subtitles.
> Holler: Southern Appalachia word for a small valley between mountains.

Currently, I am a U.S. Deparment of Energy - Office of Science Graduate Student Research Fellow pursuing a Ph.D. in Nuclear and Particle Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis research is centered on the [GlueX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlueX) experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, under the mentorship of Professor Curtis Meyer, the spokesperson of GlueX. Specifically, I investigate <em class="bold-italic">exotic hybrid</em> mesons within two pseudoscalar systems. By analyzing photoproduction processes, I aim to identify spin-exotic states such as the $\pi_1(1600)$. These states challenge the traditional quark model, advancing our understanding of quark-gluon interactions by probing gluonic excitations -- shedding light onto the mechanisms that govern the strong force.

In collaboration with Professor Mikhail Mikhasenko and the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum group in Germany, I am also conducting an angular analysis of di- $J/\psi$ systems to study the recently discovered <em class="bold-italic">exotic tetraquarks</em>. These states are produced via hadroproduction in proton-proton collisions at the [LHCb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHCb_experiment) experiment, located at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. This work focuses on understanding the properties of the observed $X(6900)$ resonance and other potential structures in the $J/\psi$ pair's invariant mass spectrum. By analyzing angular distributions, we aim to determine the resonance's quantum properties, such as spin-parity and substructure, providing deeper insights into multiquark dynamics and the mechanisms driving exotic hadron formation.

      Lastly, I am an affiliate graduate trainee leader for the Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery Institute 
      (<a href="https://a3d3.ai" target="_blank">A3D3</a>).

Increasing the speed and performance of computations, both theoretical and experimental, is critical to advancing nuclear and particle physics. To address this need, I have specialized in enhancing scientific computational research through methods such as High-Performance Computing and High-Throughput Computing. As part of this work, I was accepted to and invited to attend two specialized schools in 2022 and one in 2024, where I further developed my skills, presented my ongoing research, and collaborated with leading experts from diverse scientific disciplines worldwide.
