I grew up deep in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, tucked away in a <em>holler</em> near the boarder of Virgina and Tennessee. It's a place where cows outnumber people and apparently our accents leave people wanting subtitles.
> Holler: Southern Appalachia word for a small valley between mountains.

Currently, I am a U.S. Deparment of Energy - Office of Science Graduate Student Research Fellow pursuing a Ph.D. in Nuclear and Particle Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis research is centered on the [`GlueX`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlueX) experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, under the mentorship of Professor Curtis Meyer, the spokesperson of GlueX. Specifically, I investigate <em class="bold-italic">exotic hybrid</em> mesons within two pseudoscalar systems. By analyzing photoproduction processes, I aim to identify spin-exotic states such as the $\pi_1(1600)$. These states challenge the traditional quark model, advancing our understanding of quark-gluon interactions by probing gluonic excitations -- shedding light onto the mechanisms that govern the strong force.

In collaboration with Professor Mikhail Mikhasenko and the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum group in Germany, I am also conducting an angular analysis of di- $J/\psi$ systems to study the recently discovered <em class="bold-italic">exotic tetraquarks</em>. These states are produced via hadroproduction in proton-proton collisions at the [`LHCb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHCb_experiment) experiment, located at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. This work focuses on understanding the properties of the observed $X(6900)$ resonance and other potential structures in the $J/\psi$ pair's invariant mass spectrum. By analyzing angular distributions, we aim to determine the resonance's quantum properties, such as spin-parity and substructure, providing deeper insights into multiquark dynamics and the mechanisms driving exotic hadron formation.

Increasing the speed and performance of computations, both theoretical and experimental, is critical to advancing nuclear and particle physics. To address this need, I have specialized in enhancing scientific computational research through methods such as High-Performance Computing and High-Throughput Computing. As part of this work, I was accepted to and invited to attend two specialized schools in 2022 and one in 2024, where I further developed my skills, presented my ongoing research, and collaborated with leading experts from diverse scientific disciplines worldwide.
