I grew up deep in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, tucked away in a <em>holler</em> near the boarder of Virgina and Tennessee. It's a place where cows outnumber people and apparently our accents leave people wanting subtitles.
> Holler: Southern Appalachia word for a small valley between mountains.

Currently, I am a U.S. Deparment of Energy - Office of Science Graduate Student Research Fellow pursuing a Ph.D. in Nuclear and Particle Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis research is centered on the [GlueX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlueX) experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, under the mentorship of Professor Curtis Meyer, the spokesperson of GlueX. Specifically, I investigate <em class="bold-italic">exotic hybrid</em> mesons within two pseudoscalar systems. By analyzing photoproduction processes, I aim to identify spin-exotic states such as the $\pi_1(1600)$. These states challenge the traditional quark model, advancing our understanding of quark-gluon interactions by probing gluonic excitations -- shedding light onto the mechanisms that govern the strong force.

In collaboration with Professor Mikhail Mikhasenko and the Ruhr-Universität Bochum group in Germany, I am also conducting an angular analysis of di- $J/\psi$ systems to study the recently discovered <em class="bold-italic">exotic tetraquarks</em>. These states are produced via hadroproduction in proton-proton collisions at the [LHCb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHCb_experiment) experiment, located at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. This work focuses on understanding the properties of the observed $X(6900)$ resonance and other potential structures in the $J/\psi$ pair's invariant mass spectrum. By analyzing angular distributions, we aim to determine the resonance's quantum properties, such as spin-parity and substructure, providing deeper insights into multiquark dynamics and the mechanisms driving exotic hadron formation.


Research Interests

<hr>
The need to increase the speed and performance for all computations (whether theoretical or experimental) within High Energy and Nuclear Physics is crucial. Because of this, I have began to specialize in the enhancement of scientific computational research through several means, including: High-Performance Computing and High-Throughput Computing. For my work, I was accepted and invited to attend two schools in 2022 and one in 2024 to further develop my skills, present on my current work on the topics, and to collaborate with other leading experts from around the world in various fields and disciplines across the sciences.

An article was recently written about the talks myself and several other young scientists gave about our research in Madison, Wisonsin. 
The talks focused on how each of us utilized High-Throughput Computing in our specific fields and scientific disciplines.
