I grew up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in an small town called Abgindon. It is near the boarder of Virgina and Tennessee.

I am now a Ph.D. candidate in [Nuclear and Particle Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working on the [GlueX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlueX) experiment at the  Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. My advisor is Professor [Curtis Meyer](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/meyer.html), spokesperson of GlueX.

I recieved my Bachelor of Science degree from [The College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) with honors in Physics and Mathematics in 2019. I worked with Professor [Justin Stevens](https://www.wm.edu/as/physics/people/fulltimefaculty/stevens_j.php) from the winter of 2016 to the spring of 2019 on exclusice $\pi^{0}$ production and Compton scattering which resulted in an honors thesis.

During the summer of 2018, I was a research assistant for Dr. [Ken Livingston](http://nuclear.gla.ac.uk/infoWrapper.php?surname=Livingston) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). I worked on machine learning techniques and simulations for the development of a compact pair polarimeter and spectrometer for use in hadron
physics experiments at photon beam facilities.

Current Research
======
My area of research is searching for the existence of exotic hybrid mesons, particularly on the $\pi^{0} \eta$ and $\pi^{0} \eta'$ systems. The interest in these two systems is due to the strong possibility of the presence of exotic $J^{PC}$   (quantum) numbers in their final states. By comparing both systems, the role of flavor symmetry should be shown as to allow for a better understanding of meson production mechanisms. Implementing a partial wave analysis will provide information as to what the exotic hybrid candidate with spinexotic-signature is.
