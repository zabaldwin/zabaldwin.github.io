I grew up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in an small, rural town called Abgindon. It is near the boarder of Virgina and Tennessee.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Nuclear and Particle Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working on the [GlueX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlueX) experiment at the  Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. My advisor is Professor [Curtis Meyer](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/meyer.html), spokesperson of GlueX.

During 2019, I recieved my Bachelor of Science degree from [The College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) with honors in Physics and Mathematics. There I worked with Professor [Justin Stevens](https://www.wm.edu/as/physics/people/fulltimefaculty/stevens_j.php) from the winter of 2016 to the spring of 2019 on exclusice $\pi^{0}$ production and Compton scattering which resulted in an honors thesis.

Starting in 2018, I was granted the opportunity to become a research assistant for Dr. [Ken Livingston](http://nuclear.gla.ac.uk/infoWrapper.php?surname=Livingston) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). I worked on machine learning techniques and simulations while in Scotland for the development of a compact pair polarimeter and spectrometer for use in future hadron
physics experiments.

After working on these simulations, I helped build a prototype and test ran it on the [Mainzer Mikrotron (MAMI)](https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb08-nuclear-physics/accelerators-mami-mesa/the-mainz-microtron/) at [Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany](https://www.uni-mainz.de).

Current Research
======
My area of research is searching for the existence of exotic hybrid mesons, particularly on the $\pi^{0} \eta$ and $\pi^{0} \eta'$ systems. The interest in these two systems is due to the strong possibility of the presence of exotic $J^{PC}$   (quantum) numbers in their final states. By comparing both systems, the role of flavor symmetry should be shown as to allow for a better understanding of meson production mechanisms. Implementing a partial wave analysis will provide information as to what the exotic hybrid candidate with spin exotic-signature is.
